# passwordGenerator
 Code for a password generator.  

1. Created a randome password generator with html and css provided.

First attempt:
Consisted of creating random functions javascript code to establish random characters. 
Initially random functions excuted properly but limited to only four characters. This was not desireable as instructions gave parameters of between 8-120 characters per password generated that were determined by user input. So most code was discareded except for random character functions as those ran properly when ran through the console.log

Second Attempt:
Had difficulty setting up a way to generate a character counter to determine number of counters. Again, the issue was not resolved with conditional statements and my limited experience kept me from finding a more elegant solution.

Third Attempt: 
Decided to trash the whole thing and start fresh. Began writing pseudo code whole plan. Then added variables I'd beleive to be used. Followed next with all questions and implemented a while loop then a conditional statement to store user input. Still had the original random character selector functions so used those for this code as well. Created an array to store the user-input selections to push the necessary functions. Created a seperate function to generate the index for the number of times the selected functions should run. This finally generated the desired temporary password on the user window. 
 
 Final Thoughts:
 Definitely the hardest assignment for me personally. Still have trouble reconizing where a for or while loop is better in varied situations. Also, naming and re-naming variables makes it confusing to follow code logic. In need of some references to clarify. This is so far my biggest obstacle.
